## Objectives and competences
The goal of the course is the students to become
acquainted with the field of artificial intelligence and its
methods, which includes a collection of tools and
approaches for solving problems which are difficult or
unpractical to tackle with other methods. Students will
practically apply the theoretical knowledge on real
problems from scientific and business environment. The
students shall be able to decide for a given problem
which of the presented techniques should be used, and
to develop a prototype solution.
### General competences
developing skills in critical, analytical and synthetic
thinking,
the ability to understand and solve professional
challenges in computer and information science,
the ability of professional communication in the native
language as well as a foreign language,
***the ability to apply acquired knowledge in
independent work for solving technical and scientific
problems in computer and information science***,
familiarity with research methods in the field of
computer science.
### Subject-specific competences
using basic machine learning algorithms
preprocessing data for data mining
feature subset selection
evaluation of decision models
using data mining systems
using optimizations packages with evolutionary
techniques
text analysis and text mining
using reinforcement learning tools
## Intended learning outcomes
### Knowledge and understanding
Expertise in several techniques and methods, used in
the field of artificial intelligence. The ability for analysis,
synthesis and anticipation of solutions and their
consequences for target problems using the scientific
methodology.
### Application
The use of the presented methods on target problems
from scientific and business environment. The
understanding and usage of tools in the field of artificial
intelligence.
### Reflection
The recognition and understanding of the meaning of
basic mathematical and statistical knowledge, the
relation between theory and its application in concrete
examples of intelligent modelling and artificial
intelligence. Autonomy, (self) criticalness, (self)
reflexivity, aspiration for quality.
### Transferable skills
The transfer of the learned principles for planning of
large systems where the principles of artificial intelligent
solutions help to improve the usability and the system
performance. The ability to receive, select and evaluate
new information and proper interpretation in a context.
A self-control and ability to manage limited time when
preparing, planning and implementing plans and
processes. Team work, writing of reports and papers,
public presentations.  
Coherent mastering of basic knowledge, gained through
mandatory courses, and the ability to combine the
knowledge from different fields and to apply it in
practice.

# Seminar work 1

The goal of the seminar paper is to use machine learning methods to build forecasting models
 for air pollution, evaluate the models accordingly and clearly present the results obtained.
 
Specific tasks to be performed:  
1. Data visualization - 
Prepare some interesting graphs that illustrate the given data (value distributions,
interdependencies between attributes, repetitive patterns, and the like).  
2. Attribute evaluation - 
Evaluate the quality of the given attributes and construct new attributes that can improve
quality of built models. Hint: the date is relatively useless in its current form, from
it can, however, derive new attributes (e.g. time of year, day of the week) that potentially
help predict air pollution.  
3. Classification - 
Build at least three classification models for forecasting:
    a) maximum daily ozone concentrations - possible classes are: LOW (below 60.0),
MEDIUM (between 60.0 and 120.0), HIGH (between 120.0 and 180.0) and EXTREME (above
180.0),
    b) daily concentrations of PM10 particles - possible classes are: LOW (up to 35.0), HIGH (above
35.0).
4. Regression - 
Build at least three regression models for prediction:
    a) maximum daily ozone concentrations,
    b) daily concentrations of PM10 particles.
5. Evaluation of models - 
Evaluate the built models accordingly and present the obtained results. Compare different
models based on the achieved prediction accuracy and comprehensibility of operation.
